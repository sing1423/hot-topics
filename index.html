			<h1>Value of Money</h1>
			<img src="img/money.jpg" alt="Money" style="float: left;">
			<p>Money is a medium of exchange that facilitates trade in goods and services. Wherever people pro¬gressed beyond simple barter, they began to use their most market¬able goods as media of exchange. In primitive societies they used cattle, or measures of grain, salt, or fish. In early civilizations where the division of labor extended to larger areas, gold or silver emerged as the most marketable good and finally as the only medi¬um of exchange, called money. It is obvious that the chieftains, kings, and heads of state did not invent the use of money. But they frequently usurped control over it whenever they suffered budget deficits and could gain revenue from currency debasement.</p>
			<p>When an economic good is sought and wanted, not only for its use in consumption or production but also for purposes of exchange, to be held in reserve for later ex¬changes, the demand for it obvi¬ously increases. We may then speak of two partial demands which combine to raise its value in exchange—its purchasing power.

			<h1>GMO food</h1>
			<img src="img/food.jpg" alt="Food" style="float: left;">
			<p>A genetically modified organism, or GMO, is an organism that has had its DNA altered or modified in some way through genetic engineering.<br><br>In most cases, GMOs have been altered with DNA from another organism, be it a bacterium, plant, virus or animal; these organisms are sometimes referred to as "transgenic" organisms. Genetics from a spider that helps the arachnid produce silk, for example, could be inserted into the DNA of an ordinary goat.</p>
			<p>It sounds far-fetched, but that is the exact process used to breed goats that produce silk proteins in their goat milk, Science Nation reported. Their milk is then harvested, and the silk protein is then isolated to make a lightweight, ultrastrong silk material with a wide range of industrial and medical uses.<br><br>The dizzying range of GMO categories is enough to boggle the mind. CRISPR, a novel genome editing tool, has allowed geneticists to breed GMO pigs that glow in the dark by inserting jellyfish bioluminescence genetic code into pig DNA. CRISPR is opening doors to genetic modifications the likes of which were unimaginable just a decade ago.<a href="http://http://www.livescience.com/">http://www.livescience.com/</a></p>

			<h1>The view of world in 2100</h1>
			<img src="img/future.jpg" alt="Robot" style="float: left;">
			<p>We all know that the carbon legacy of our fossil fuel-based lifestyles is bequeathing a climate crisis to billions of people into the future. But when we say “future”, just how far should we be thinking ahead? As far as 2050? 2100? Or a little bit further, maybe as far as 2500 and beyond?<br><br>You may have already noticed that future climate projections used by the international scientific and political communities generally go only as far as the year 2100. The simple reason for this is that it is impossible to predict with any degree of accuracy just how much greenhouse gases are going to be released in the next few centuries, and just how much this is going to affect the climate.</p>
			<p>But don’t be fooled. This does not mean that climate change will cease to be a problem in the years lying beyond the upper reach of our most cited climate forecasts. The shocking truth is that climate change has only just begun. Regardless of future emission trends, the CO2 footprint from our brief passage on Earth is going to remain in the climate system and impact the well-being of all terrestrial life forms for what could almost be considered an eternity. - <a href="https://ourworld.unu.edu/en/climate-change-what-happens-after-2100">https://ourworld.unu.edu/en/climate-change-what-happens-after-2100</a></p>
